# ATS Job Search Generator

A simple yet powerful single-page web application designed to streamline the job search process. This tool allows users to generate targeted Google search queries for job postings across a curated list of popular Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).

It's built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on usability, performance, and a clean user interface.

## Features

- **Targeted ATS Searching**: Search for jobs directly on platforms like Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workday, and more.
- **Customizable Queries**: Refine searches with keywords, location, and work type (Any, Remote, Hybrid, On-Site).
- **"Search All" Functionality**: Open search tabs for all supported ATS platforms at once with a single click (browser permission may be required).
- **Quick Region Filters**: Use pre-defined buttons for common geographical regions (e.g., USA, Europe, UK, APAC) to auto-fill complex location queries.
- **Persistent Inputs**: Your last search criteria (keywords, location, work type) are saved in local storage, so you can pick up where you left off.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: A sleek theme toggle that respects your OS-level color scheme preference and saves your choice.
- **Responsive Design**: A clean, mobile-first interface that works great on any device.
- **AJAX Contact Form**: A "Get in Touch" section with a contact form that submits data asynchronously without a page reload.
- **No Dependencies**: Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks or libraries are needed.

## How to Use

1.  **Enter Keywords**: Type the job titles, skills, or technologies you're looking for (e.g., `Software Engineer, Python`).
2.  **Specify Location (Optional)**:
    -   Type a city, country, or region (e.g., `London`, `USA`).
    -   Or, click one of the **Region** pill buttons for a pre-formatted query (e.g., `United States / USA`).
3.  **Select Work Type (Optional)**: Choose between `Any`, `Remote`, `Hybrid`, or `On-Site`.
4.  **Search**:
    -   Click an individual **ATS button** (like `Lever` or `Greenhouse`) to open a Google search for that specific platform in a new tab.
    -   Click the **Search All ATS** button to open a new tab for *every* ATS in the list. You will be asked to confirm this action.
5.  **Clear**: Click the **Clear Fields** button to reset all inputs and remove the saved criteria from your browser.
